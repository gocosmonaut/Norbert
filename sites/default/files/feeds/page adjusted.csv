Contrary to industry trends, we are committed to maintaining our employee ownership structure, as we believe it best serves our clients and staff.</p><p>The prospect of ownership has been a powerful tool for us in recruiting and retaining outstanding professionals who have brought expertise to our firm and continue to identify ways to best serve our individual and institutional clients. Seventy-seven percent of our 43 employees own shares in the firm and six principal owners share firm-wide management responsibilities.</p><p>Our principal owners are in their 50s and 60s, providing a stable environment for long-term relationships with clients. There has been no turnover in investment professionals in the last 26 years.</p><p>The firm is led by a board of directors and investment professionals who work in a team structure for investment management and client service. Since 2007, a percentage of outstanding shares have been sold between the board of directors and the firm's executive and senior vice presidents. This is an ongoing exchange to transition ownership.</p><p>In addition to providing consistent investment management performance, reputable service and comprehensive reporting, many of our employees are active, contributing leaders in communities where we serve clients.</p>"3,3,page,und,Expertise,1,1,1306512552,1432483090,1,0,0,0,0,"<p><strong>Our in-house expertise</strong><br /><p>As a 100 percent <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/about-us/people"">employee</a>-owned firm, we are able to attract and retain professionals who have enabled us to have in-house expertise on creating balanced portfolios and developing a wide range of investment strategies.</p><p>Our investment team consists of <a href=""[site:url]about-us/investment-team"">portfolio managers and analysts</a> who possess an average of more than 24 years of experience.

Individual securities also afford us the ability to structure portfolios to meet a client's liabilities, cash flow or income needs by limiting the sale of securities to raise cash. This reduces transaction costs to the portfolio.</p><p>We start with asset allocation and use multiple asset class strategies to provide competitive returns while reducing volatility (risk). We are active managers of many asset classes, including large-cap domestic equities, international equities (developed markets and emerging markets), real estate investment trusts (REITs) and several fixed income strategies. If appropriate, small-cap equities, private equity and hedge funds are strategies which are outsourced to managers that have been thoroughly vetted by our investment team.</p>"4,4,page,und,Individuals and Families,1,1,1306512585,1432489832,1,0,0,0,0,"<p>For more than 39 years, Ferguson Wellman has helped individuals and families navigate through the complexities of wealth management.

Although our core business is investment management using individual securities to build customized portfolios &ndash; our client service capabilities have grown over the years. Other areas in which clients utilize our expertise are through our <a href=""[site:url]expertise/investment-services"">Investment Services</a> and <a href=""[site:url]expertise/communication-and-education"">Communication and Education</a>.</p><p>Beyond these services, clients seek our advice on other issues, such as taxes, estate planning, private banking, real estate investments, capital campaigns, gifting and organizational issues facing institutions, family business and foundations.</p><p>Often we refer clients to trusted professionals we have worked with over the years. Together we work seamlessly to provide our <a href=""[site:url]individuals-and-families"">individual </a>and<a href=""[site:url]institutions""> institutional </a>clients with the expertise and experience that can help in their planning and decision making process.</p><p>Please refer to our <a href=""[site:url]consultants-and-professionals"">Consultants and Professionals</a> section for more information about working together to serve your clients.</p>"164,164,page,und,Contact Us,1,1,1311701636,1369418762,0,0,0,0,0,"<p>Since <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/~ferguson/about-us/history"">1975</a>, our assets under management have grown consistently due to new clients, transfer of assets and market growth. In the past decade, the equity markets have worked against growing assets; however, we currently are experiencing a trajectory of growth for our firm and our clients since the market lows of 2008.</p><p  style=""""><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/assets/Assets_0.png"" style=""height: 418px; width: auto;"" /></p><p><em>Updated annually -- as of 12/31/14</em></p>"207,207,page,und,Tactical Assets,1,1,1312906971,1315609553,0,0,0,0,0,"<p><img alt="""" src=""/sites/default/files/assets/Assets%20by%20Client%20Type_1.png"" style=""width: 368px; height: 265px; float: right;"" />Diversification in the types of clients we serve was an intentional strategy for accomplishing three goals. First, it gives us the opportunity to employ <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/~ferguson/expertise/investment-strategies"">investment strategies</a> and <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/~ferguson/expertise/investment-services"">services</a> needed by one client type to another. For example, our expertise in serving large <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/~ferguson/institutions"">institutions</a> has given individuals and families confidence in our capabilities. Conversely, many investment communication resources and education programs we designed for <a href=""http://fergusonwellman.com/~ferguson/individuals-and-families"">individuals</a> have become valuable to institutions- particularly to foundations and endowments. Second, through diversification, our clients have benefitted from the stability of having a range of revenue sources for the firm.</p><p>Lastly, our various client types have supported our ""word-of-mouth""ù strategy for growth. Based on our performance and client service, trustees have referred individuals to us. Also, we have been introduced to many institutions through our individual clients. We believe the best referrals we can receive are from those who have worked directly with us- personally or professionally.</p><p><em>Updated annually -- as of 12/31/14</em></p><p></p><p></p>"215,215,page,und,Benchmarks,1,1,1313622142,1362499938,0,0,0,0,0,216,216,page,und,Privacy Policy,1,1,1313690599,1387917848,0,0,0,0,0,217,217,page,und,Large Cap Dividend Value,1,1,1313692091,1433201868,0,0,0,0,0,218,218,page,und,Large-Cap Core Equity,1,1,1313692338,1436886413,0,0,0,0,0,219,219,page,und,Wealth Management for Clients,1,1,1313693896,1315603587,0,0,0,0,0,220,220,page,und,Investment Strategies Chart,1,1,1313694846,1389902925,0,0,0,0,0,222,222,page,und,Alternative Assets,1,1,1315439381,1326306806,0,0,0,0,0,223,223,page,und,Uncorrelated Assets,1,1,1315609243,1315870480,0,0,0,0,0,226,226,page,und,Business Update to Umpqua Private Bank - September,5,0,1316724445,1339782605,0,0,0,0,0,231,231,page,und,"Portland, Oregon's Capital Management Professionals",7,1,1316806171,1316806360,0,0,0,0,0,234,234,page,und,The Guide to Fergusonwellman.com,5,1,1318544906,1367951774,0,0,0,0,0,240,240,page,und,Business Update to Umpqua Private Bank - October,5,0,1319640588,1339782566,0,0,0,0,0,263,263,page,und,Our Creative Inspiration,5,1,1327626047,1329524694,0,0,0,0,0,265,265,page,und,Benchmarks for Our Investment Strategies ,5,1,1327626187,1362499897,0,0,0,0,0,266,266,page,und,Overview of Our Investment Services,5,1,1327626268,1329514652,0,0,0,0,0,267,267,page,und,Descriptions of Our Communication and Education ,5,1,1327626324,1329514735,0,0,0,0,0,269,269,page,und,Executive Assistant Job Description,5,1,1328130493,1328130859,0,0,0,0,0,284,284,page,und,Fixed Income Portfolio Manager  ,5,1,1337815265,1337815520,0,0,0,0,0,295,295,page,und,Sample RFP,5,1,1343403513,1343403760,0,0,0,0,0,310,310,page,und,Current Quarterly Financial Highlights for 2012,5,1,1358887024,1358887024,0,0,0,0,0,311,311,page,und,Benchmarks for Our Investment Strategies ,5,1,1358887136,1358887136,0,0,0,0,0,324,324,page,und,Client Login,5,1,1369415846,1369415846,0,0,0,0,0,421,421,page,und,Remembering Jorge Chavarria,5,1,1428777343,1429044446,0,0,0,0,0,441,441,page,und,Remembering Norbert J.
